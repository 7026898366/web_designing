<!--Hi htsdsdsml is very cool to learn-->
<p>
what is the difference between git stash apply and
Git stash pop?
ans.the 'Git stash apply 'and'Git stash pop'commands
are used when you have to reapply the
stashed changes and start working from where you left.
<
The differences between them is that while the 
'Git stash apply'command keeps the changes in 
the stash list for later use,the 'Git stash pop'command
removes the changes from the stash
after applying it.
