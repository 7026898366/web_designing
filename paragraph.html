<!--Hi htsdsml is very cool to learn-->
<p>
about circuit lab?
ans:circuitlab uses the dynmaic model of the elements
in your circuit work out the voltages and currents in
your circuit at every time step. this means that it
is very important to choose an appropriate time step
for your transient simulation.
</p>

circuitlab is an in-browser schematic capture and
circuit simulation software tool to help you
rapidly design and analyze analog and digital
electronics systems.
